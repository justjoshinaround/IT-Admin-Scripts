Most scripts will be for whatever MDM, RMM, etc. that I am being forced to use at the time.
Use whatever you want, however you want, but just know all of these are written by some random dude on the internet.
Test EVERYTHING on a test device before pushing anything to a live environment.
I feel like a boomer on Facebook by saying this, but I am not accountable for any fires/problems you cause by using these scripts.
